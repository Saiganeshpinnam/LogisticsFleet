# Logistics Fleet - Frontend (Generated)

This frontend was generated by ChatGPT and mirrors the component structure discussed.

## Quick start

1. cd LogisticsFleet-frontend
2. npm install
3. Create a `.env` file with:
   VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000/api
   VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:4000
4. npm run dev

## Notes
- Ensure your backend exposes the routes used in `src/services/api.js`.
- Socket.io must be served from the backend for real-time location updates.
